<h1>Local Drones</h1>

<p>This was my final project at RefactorU. The site was built using NodeJS, the Jade templating engine, and Heroku hosting. I came up with the concept for the website and built the complete app in only 1.5 weeks. The idea of the site was to combine by interests in drones / model aircraft and web development. The site allows people like real estate agents, event coordinators, etc. to post projects for which they would like to hire a drone to perform aerial photography. Local drone hobbyists and RC aerial photography companies can then bid on projects.</p>
